    <h2>You Can Only Change Yourself</h2>

    <p>
        No matter how much effort you put into an individual or time you spend on them, you cannot change that person. This seems like common sense,
        but many seem to overlook the fact that it takes that person's own will to make a true change. Many are out to play savior to others,
        often firmly believing they can do so. In reality, the most you can do is push and attempt to direct and motivate the other person
        to do the work needed that will benefit them to become something greater.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        In the same sense, you can only change yourself. At the end of the day, it is up to you to do what is needed to make the change.
        While others can help encourage you and even boost your determination, it lies on you to do the work. Be careful that you do not
        get caught up in simply talking about what needs done. It is easy to find an excellent viewpoint, method, and technique that
        harmonizes with you and that you feel will greatly benefit you. It is important to remember here that action purifies thought.
        Without acting upon what we learn, we will never improve or apply the ideas we have learned. It would be like having a blueprint
        for a house yet never making the first effort to build that house.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        We understand that acting on these ideas is not easy. On the contrary, it is usually extremely difficult. For the alcoholic,
        abstaining from drinking may seem impossible. But it is not. Here is where the support network plays a heavy role. The right
        companions can aide you in your quest to breaking your addiction. Even so, it remains up to you to do the work and not take
        that drink. The same can be said with battling any affliction or striving to improve yourself or your surroundings.
        Do not expect some magical intervention to cure you of your ailment. It is up to you and your determination to make the change.
        Peace and love to you all.
