    <h2>Karma</h2>

    <p>
        Good vs. evil is a worldwide theme that has been continously passed down since ancient times. It is especially present in the bible where the prophecy
        of an upcoming great war lives. However, the fact of the matter is that there can be no universal war against God--it is impossible. What creation 
        can stand against a force that brought it into existence? None. The great war exists, but it is an internal struggle against oneself. We discussed 
        this in the <a href="@Url.Action("GetSermon", "Sermons", new { id = 6 })">previous sermon</a>. To believe that anything would be able to go against 
        the will of God is to limit the power of God and truly not understanding that this power encompasses all.
    </p>

        That being said, when we view the biblical war of Armageddon, we must realize there is no return of Christ for the vanquishing of the marked ones. There 
        is no need for such a war, thanks to the amazing design of God. The simple statement, "what goes around comes around" sums up the reason for never needing 
        a war or divine punishment. The universe is designed in such a matter to balance itself and everything in it. Our of chaos comes order, and for us as 
        individuals there is no exception. If I decide to diet on pizza and soda, eventually my body will take this garbage and return it to you in the form of 
        sickness. In the same manner, our actions dictate what will come into our lives in the future. By making the choices today, we are building the shape of 
        tomorrow.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        On a broader scale, the actions taken by others to harm life, cause suffering, and create oppression will also return in their given time. There is no
        need to make yourself a part of these by sending out hatred towards individuals who are making such decisions. It is more advantageous to not project
        anger that will also come around to us! By breaking the channel, we can avoid this problem and still be confident that this system of "what goes around
        comes around" works for everyone, and no one ever escapes reprecussions, be it in this life or the next. Karma is thus this: the effusive cycle of our
        positive and negative projections returning to us in the form of life events. We make our own karma, and our own destiny.
