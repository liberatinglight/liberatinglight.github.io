    <h2>Saul of Tarsus</h2>

    <p>
        If you carefully examine the story of Christ, you can easily see that the "Apostle" Paul is an irrelevant and even dangerous individual.
        Christ is God in the flesh or in some faiths the son of God who originated from a different ontology. He has come to earth to spread the
        divine message, then save all mankind with the ultimate sacrifice. Three days later, he returns for a brief time before ascending to
        heaven in lieu of judgement day, which is swiftly arriving. Some time later a serial killer comes along, specifically targeting Christians.
        This Saul of Tarsus later went on to write a little over a quarter of the New Testament, which eventually became the foundation for modern Christianity.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        If the son of God or even God himself decended to spread a message, it is hard to believe that such a message would be anything but complete
        and perfect, a manifestation of the divine from which it came. When we look at the gospels we see that Jesus spent his entire life spreading
        the word while at the same time preparing  twelve individuals to carry out the work once he is gone, pushing it to the very ends of the earth.
        Before his ascension to heaven, he reminded the apostles that they had been given everything they needed and not to fear but to boldy go
        forth as proclaimers. After this, he ascended to heaven to sit at the right hand of God.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        The story of the Christ inspires several questions about Paul. Jesus provided the apostles with everything they needed to spread the good news.
        With that in mind, what does Paul give me that Jesus didn't? By accepting Paul's teachings as fruits of the spirit, we are in a way acknowledging
        that the teachings of Jesus were not enough, and that Paul was a necessary part in spreading the word, even though he never met the Christ and also
        fell out with some of the true apostles. How can the divine message of Jesus be lacking in anything? It's not. While the Christ taught love and
        freedom for all, Saul came on what could be seen as an early crusade, intent on destroying every follower of these teachings. The Christ warned
        against individuals like Paul, who would come in his name and mislead many. This prophecy is exactly what happened, when a serial killer changed
        his path to become an unholy force, spreading dogma which would eventually evolve into the Pauline theology that is now rampant in our day.
