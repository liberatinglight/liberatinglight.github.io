    <h2>Killing In The Name</h2>

    <p>
        When you look back into history, religion 
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        The path to God flows through every channel of existence, since all routes lead us home. As cells of the infinite mass that is God, we are always 
        connected to the embodient of the whole. Many come through prayer, while others come through vice or addiction. No matter where you are in life, 
        you can always connect to the present and to God, without need of any third-party intermediary. You simply start this moment. As our thoughts manifest 
        into our life, we can choose to rebuild with positivity. When we are acting with our intuition as an aid, we will be aligned with our higher self and be able to maintain a beneficial balance. Our intuition or
        gut feeling is always there to guide us, like a compass pointing to true north.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Regardless of what religion you are, you will never be destroyed for your beliefs, as some would want you to believe. The number of religious sects today
        pale in comparison to the amount that existed in areas like ancient Rome. Even here, individuals were doing the same thing as they do now, dividing
        themselves with schism after schism, until religion (meaning to bind) had separated all of them. Individuals can be so consumed with arguing religion
        that the very devil they claim to despise is seen clearly manifested in their behavior. With so many little arguments, it's not surprising that this
        leads to complete abstinence from living the golden rule, an integral part of beliefs.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Continue to walk your path. Continue to benefit yourself. And
        continue to give thanks and praise the way you want. You can never go wrong by following your inner tuition and doing your own thing, especially in
        the face of opposition. If anything, opposition is the system's way of helping you grow stronger by pushing you through to the other side. In these
        instances, we can continue to walk the path that will indeed lead us to our desired destination.
