    <h2>Make the Truth Your Own</h2>

    <p>
        In nearly all academic or theological presentations, listeners are often provided a multitude of references, quotes, and/or source material. The idea behind this move is that it will strengthen the individual's argument being presented. Here at Liberating Light Church, we do no such thing. But why? you may ask. Why would a church of all places not want to strengthen their own message? The idea is simple. The strength of the message is in the thought you provide it. To meditate on and think about the material being presented allows you to easily discern whether the words spoken are in harmony or dissonance with your personal self.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        We want you to think about these things on your own. How do you feel about them? What kind of emotional response do our words elicit? In many traditional religious institutions, the disciple is often never asked about their own opinion or feeling. On the contrary, any idea or response that is not in harmony with the church is shunned, silenced, and can even lead to expulsion or excommunication. We find that ironic, since we do not believe that the truth fears any inquiry. Also, we believe it is important for the individual to seriously consider matters for themselves, as this not only allows for greater understanding but a stronger personal experience.
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        Thus, our invitation to you is simple. If you are enjoying what we have to say, stop and think about it for yourself. Consider new possibilities and meanings as you also consider our message. And most importantly, do not believe anything we say for the simple fact that we are saying it. Work on your own to look into different ideas and presentations and come to your own conclusion. We are all different extensions of the source and for that reason alone we will all seek different methods about which we go. We encourage you to embrace the method that works for you and to always question what is being said, helping lead you to your own individual perspective. Peace and love to you all.
