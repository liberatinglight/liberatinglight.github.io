    <h2>You Don't Need Church</h2>

    <p>
        How ironic, to talk about not needing Church from an entity with church in their title. Well, that's the message here--you don't need church, 
        or any mass organization; all you need is your intuition. Individuals have had their heads so filled with rubbish and distraction that they 
        have all but banished their own inner voice. Luckily, it's still there. But wait, aren't these organizations big for a reason. And haven't 
        they saved millions of people? Yes, and so has the sword, but which side of it were you on?
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Now everyone is different of course--many go to church to meet friends, be a part of a collective consciousness, or take advantage of free 
        day care. Of course there are also those who feel that this is where they go to worship God, as if this being even needs worshipping. God, 
        the universe, Jesus, Buddha, whatever you wish to call it. For some reason, even though this entity created all existence, it has this 
        special house or building that you must go to. And it's not good enough to simply enjoy the life you were given or 
        show appreciation through how you treat other life. No, you need to go here and read from an archaic book of lore that dictates all your 
        actions, not because you desire to behave this way, but because you are told this is the way in which you must act or face everlasting 
        destruction or even torture.

    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Being an extension of this all powerful entity, you are like a cell of an infinite mass. Your ontology is of the source, and you have a 
        constant connection with it. Since this is so, all answers you seek are inside you, lying under the pile of thoughts and distractions that 
        silenced your inner voice to begin with. There is no collection plate, no thousand page instruction manual, and no filler. There is only truth, 
        and the source. For you are one with it. Peace and love to you all.
    </p>
