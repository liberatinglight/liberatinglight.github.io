    <h2>Defining God</h2>

    <p>
        In nearly all religions, you find traits and characteristics linked to any number of given Gods. Vengeful, jealous, just--these are but few
        of many adjectives used to describe what we call God. As the creator from which everything came, it is peculiar that you would even use words
        to try and describe something that encompasses all existence. We can see God's power manifested in trees, birds, rivers and seas, within our
        bodies, and in the wind and rain and cycle of seasons--all of these things represent that which is incomprehensible. How then, can you successfully
        explain the infinite by using a finite set of terms?
    </p>

    <br />

    <p>
        To define God is to limit what God is. Out of the creator came forth all things, and all things are an extension of its energy. With so many 
        wonders of creation and existence, there are an unlimited amount of resources that reflect God's personality. These express wonders which 
        cannot justly be understood and can only be conveyed through individual experience. They provide us with a far more powerful glimpse into 
        what God is while never saying a word. God is all things, and we only need to look at the many magnificent objects both large and small. 
        Just as the beauty of a flower silently elicits a powerful response, so too does focusing on all creation brings us one step closer to 
        understandable the unnameable all.
