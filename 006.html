    <h2>Internal Struggle</h2>

    <p>
        The most difficult struggle within this existence is the battle against yourself. During your time here you will often struggle to get motivated 
        to do something that will benefit you. Many find it difficult to keep a steady workout, quit smoking, or try to avoid unhealthy eating habits. 
        In each of these examples, it is the desire within that is the real problem. And the more you focus on what you desire the more powerful the 
        draw becomes. Control of yourself can arguably be considered harder than control of others. You are truly your own worst enemy.
    </p>

    <p>
        When bad things happen, it is easy to become angry with God or the system as being unjust or unfair. If you believe that a highly intelligent being 
        designed everything around you, you should trust that being to design a system equally as intelligent. Though the marvel of design often leaves us 
        in the dark about many pertinent questions, we can trust things are being handled and not to worry. There is honestly nothing for us to worry about. 
        However, it may help to be careful that this lack of understanding does not blind you from the possibility that things are happening as they should. 
    </p>

    <p>
        It is easy to be shaken up by bad news or a bad experience. When we are grounded enough to secure what we can, we must also move like water, being 
        flexible to experience change and ready to release old habits as we continue to evolve. Often times we are able to reflect upon one experience and 
        see how it affected us for a positive change. By staying in the present and continuously working to change our behavioral patterns, we can always 
        expect to see results and a step further along our true path.
